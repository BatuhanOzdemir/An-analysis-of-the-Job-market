# An analysis of the Job market
The program searches the website Kariyer.net for Jod ads and retrieves the specific tags, which contain data about the ad itself.
For example, data like job location, Position, Full / Part-time, etc. are stored inside a CSV file for later analysis.
The aim is to retrieve public data from one of the most popular job sites and perform analysis on that data to gain insights about the job market itself, 
since the data is self procured this kind of analysis can easily be extended to other popular sites to gain a more complete picture of the job market.

The project/program is in its infancy and is not capable of many things, however at the time of writing program retrieves ad information from the said site and stores it on a CSV file
There is also room for improvement in the efficiency area because it is quite an early prototype finding a working solution was more important than efficiency.

However, the program can retrieve and store information about 600 job ads in little over 3 minutes 

Further improvements will change the structure of the info list, it will become the main source of ad information and will also contain the ad's content and last upgrade time
Also in the later stages, there will be an interface with data visualizations to ease the analysis process.
